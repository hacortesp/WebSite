About
=====

I am a **Postdoctoral Research Fellow** at the **Basque Center for Applied Mathematics (BCAM)**,
working in the *Modelling and Simulation in Life and Material Sciences (MSLMS)* group.

My research focuses on:

- Multiscale modeling of battery materials
- Solid-state electrolytes
- Force-field development
- Molecular dynamics and first-principles simulations

I obtained my PhD in **Science and Technology (Physics)** from the
National University of General San Martín (Argentina), working at CNEA.
