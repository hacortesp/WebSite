Computational Materials Scientist – Theoretical Physicist

Henry Andrés Cortés Páez is a computational materials scientist and theoretical physicist currently working as a Severo Ochoa postdoctoral researcher at the Basque Center for Applied Mathematics (BCAM) in Spain. His research focuses on atomistic and multiscale modeling of materials for energy storage, with particular emphasis on solid-state and lithium-based batteries. He combines first-principles calculations, molecular dynamics, and data-driven analysis to understand ion transport, interfacial phenomena, and structure–property relationships in complex materials systems.
